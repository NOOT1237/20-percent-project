# Proposal: Cyno (First person horror game)
## First person horror game where you are trapped in an abandoned dog pound
Isaac Blake

## Needs and Opportunities
Many first person horror games fail to fully deliver a creepy experience, usually to the dismay of the player. I will be learning from the failure of others by trying to make a very atmospheric game, with the use of chasing being the main attraction of the experience. 

## Audience / Clients / Users
Anyone that finds joy in scary games will be attracted to this game, seeing as how atmosphere and the minor use of jump-scares will be used. My sister is a pretty big fan when it comes to horror games. She visits often from college, so she will be able to test during the times she is home. I also can use my friends who can provide harsh feedback.

## Product
At the end of the year I will show my game, whether finished or not.The finished game will be fully playable, have an ending and working gameplay, and will have as little bugs as possible. I can also provide music/textures/assets if you want me to. I will be using unity so any of that stuff will be easily accessible.

## Timeline
What is your monthly timeline for this project. I want to see a list of
deliverables with deadlines. You may find that the timeline needs adjustment
during the course of the year, which may be fine. Check in with me if that is
the case. 

| Date          | Deliverable   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| February 26| Have the first area (the forest) worked on 
| April 1| Have c# worked into the project as well as the research facility made
|April 29|  Game working with lots of bugs, debugging next        

## Reality Check
Materials:
  My computer
  Unity 5 - I will be using the free version
  
Things that will cost money
  Textures(maybe) - I will look more into making textures by hand, but for right now I am planning on buying desirable textures on the                    unity store. Basic texture packs go from 20 -40 dollars. Money is NOT a problem for me.
  Music/sounds - Again this one is a maybe. I will use scripting in c# to make some sound effects, but i dont know exactly how to do                    that. music can be bought on the unity store, but i might also make my own using apps online.I will update you on                     what will cost money in this category. 

## Conclusion
I am extremely excited to start making an actual game! I have wanted to experiement in game design my whole life and now I finally have the chance to. I will be working hard on this project the accomplish as much as I can, and then some more.
